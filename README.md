ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @callumrjohn

I'm a final year chemistry PhD student at Imperial College London, working within the Bull and Greenaway Groups.
I collaborate with Janssen Pharmaceuticals to develop and automate late-stage functionalisation methods for the diversification of complex drugs and natural products.
