ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @callumrjohn

I'm a postgraduate chemistry researcher at Imperial College London, working in the Bull and Greenaway Groups.
I collaborate with Janssen Pharamseuticals to develop and automate late-stage functionalisation reactions for the diversification of complex drugs and natural products. 
Many of my coding work focuses on the design of dispense protocols for robots that handle the chemicals I work with.
