ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @callumrjohn

I'm a postgraduate chemistry researcher at Imperial College London, working within the Bull and Greenaway Groups.
I collaborate with Janssen Pharmaceuticals to develop and automate late-stage functionalisation reactions for the chemical diversification of complex drugs and natural products. 
Much of my coding work currently focuses on the design of dispense protocols for robots that handle the chemicals I work with. Soon, I hope to use machine learning to predict some optimal conditions for the reactions I work on.
